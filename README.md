# hello-world

Hi humans!

I like cookies, the apple pie, the animals and enjoy traveling and caring for my little orchid called "Matilda Antoinette"

Responsible professional, punctual, integral, objective, logical, flexible, dynamic, used to work in a team and under pressure. Passionate for technology, art and fashion, eager to be involved with new projects to contribute all my energy and enthusiasm in the realization of philanthropic activities, non profit, volunteering and public attention.
